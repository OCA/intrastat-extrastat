This addon allows you to define an "Incoterm" and an "Intrastat Transport Mode" at the
"Shipping Methods" of sales. When these values are established, they will be the ones
that prevail in the sales orders, if they are not defined, the default values that were
established in "Settings" will apply.

The mode of transport and incoterm are assigned to the sales order when it goes from
"Quotation" to "Order". Additionally, the values will be dragged to the invoices created
from that sales order.

It is recommended to set TRUE the "Show incoterms in orders and invoices" value at
"Settings / Sales".
