This addon allows you to define an "Incoterm" and an "Intrastat
Transport Mode" at the "Shipping Methods" of sales. When these values
are established, they will be the ones that prevail in the sales orders,
if they are not defined, the default values that were established in
the tab "Other info", section "DELIVERY" will apply.

The mode of transport and incoterm are assigned to the sales order when
it goes from "Quotation" to "Order". Additionally, the values will be
dragged to the invoices created from that sales order.
