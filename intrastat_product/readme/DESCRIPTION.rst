This module contains common objects and fields for the Intrastat Product reporting.

It should be used in combination with country-specific Intrastat Product reporting modules
such as:

- *l10n_fr_intrastat_product*:
  the module for the *DÃ©claration d'Echange de Biens* (DEB) for France
- *l10n_be_intrastat_product*:
  the module for the Intrastat Product Declaration for Belgium

These country-specific modules can be found in the OCA localization for those countries.
