The OCA module *product_harmonized_system* adds a many2one field *hs_code_id* on product templates that points to an *H.S. Code* object. But the *delivery* module from the official addons adds a char field *hs_code* on product templates, which has the same purpose, but we can't use it because we need structured data for H.S. codes. This module hides the *hs_code* field added by the *delivery* module, to avoid confusion.
