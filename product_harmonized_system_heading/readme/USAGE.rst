In order to assign the H.S. Code Heading to a new H.S. Code, we first need to have the
Heading created, if there is none when creating the Code, the user will see an error
demanding to create the Heading first.

The relation is not editable from the User prespective as we just to need to ensure that
the Headings are created before creating the H.S. Codes.
